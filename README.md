# Bridge Troll

Don’t let your first cross-chain experience be a bad one - use Bridge Troll to fund your 1st gas transaction on your Layer 2 or cross chain account. 

Our goal is to help inspire people to explore the fun and cheap scaling solutions without being discouraged by the initial bridge over. 
Pay the toll troll once and cross that bridge to freedom! 


How does a normal bridge work? Here is a diagram showing a bridge between Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain:

## How would the Bridge Troll Model differ? 

There would be no need for minting or burning in our smart contracts. Instead we are simply creating a smart contract on the Ethereum side that accepts deposits from users. 

We are then waiting for this action to occur on the Fantom Opera side and once it occurs, will trigger the api to go and collect the necessary information - the depositors address. 

The smart contract that is deployed on the Fantom Network will then send FTM (the native gas token for that blockchain) to the same address that deposited above.

Currently helping Bridge the Gap between ETH and FTM. 

## Next Toll Trolls that will be sent out soon: 

	✔️ XDai 

	✔️ Polygon (Formally Matic)

	✔️ Binance Smart Chain

	✖️ Energy Web (Already has a free faucet provided by the Every Web team, YAY!) If this were to change, a Toll Troll would be released to help bridge to this chain. 

Any more recommendations? We’d love to hear your suggestions and feedback!
